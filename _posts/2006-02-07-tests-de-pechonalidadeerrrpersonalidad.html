<p><span style="font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">You are most like    Gandalf. You are very smart for your age, but don't get too proud. With that great brain of yours, you have a tendency to over-analyze stuff. Life isn't as difficult as you think it is. You have a great sense of responsibility to care for others, and that's good! Just make sure you don't neglect yourself in the process.</span></p>

But tut, there's no such thing!<br />Let others ponder thoughts of wrong and right,<br /> Or sit and think how much they love the spring;<br />I'd rather spend my time in gleeful spite,<br /> Or maybe laugh, or maybe sit and sing.<br />Besides, it might be fun to be inspiring -<br />But surely it would get so very tiring.</td>
