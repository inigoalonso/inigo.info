<p>In the high school gym, all the girls in the class were lined up against one wall, and all the boys against the opposite wall. Then, every ten seconds, they walked toward each other until they were half the previous distance apart. A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were asked, "When will the girls and boys meet?"<br />
The mathematician said: "Never."<br />
The physicist said: "Eventually, they will come to a point where they would be required to move less than 1.616252(81)Ã—1035 meters closer together. From the uncertainty principle, we know we cannot measure position more accurately than that. So either they will not move at all, or they will superimpose at that point."<br />
The engineer said: "Well... in about two minutes, they'll be close enough for all practical purposes."</p>
