<p>En este artículo acerca de si <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2006/01/reptile_play.html">las tortugas juegan</a> he pescado este par de parrafos:</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/w/wittgens.htm">Wittgenstein</a><span style="font-style:italic;"> said:"If a lion could talk, we would not understand him" (Philosophical Investigations II, xi, p. 223). What the philosopher was getting at was that even if we could understand the referents of a lion's words (that "roar" means "zebra", and "rar rar roar" means "Make mine a zebra burger") we would still have no basis for understanding lion ethics, politics, humour, religion, aesthetics and so forth, because true understanding requires empathy bourne of similarity of experience. It is questionable how well we achieve this with other human beings much of the time, let alone with another species.</span><br /> 
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-style:italic;">[...]</span></div>
<p>  <span style="font-style:italic;">Like so much of science (and despite the strenuous objections of scientific fundamentalists), there is a boundary of belief: science does not uncover big-t Truth, but merely reports the results of observations, experimental or logical. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what they believe. No-one believes the results of every scientific experiment - half of them contradict the other half, after all! We decide which results we permit into our belief system. It's part of what makes each of us an individual.</span></div>
