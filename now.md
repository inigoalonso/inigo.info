Since mid April 2019, I am on a long term study leave from my job at the [European Spallation Source ERIC](https://europeanspallationsource.se), pursuing a PhD degree in Product Development at the [Systems Engineering Design group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ims/research/product-development/Pages/systems-engineering-design.aspx), Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden).

I continue to live in Malmö, commuting to Göteborg as needed.
